# amplify-vue-task-tracker
Task manager build with VueJS, TailwindCSS and AWS Amplify.
With this task manager you can create projects and within that project you can create tasks. The task status can be toggled when clicking on a task. 

Building a simple app like this is very easy using Amplify. Within a couple of minutes you can add authentication, data and storage. All the data is synching in realtime so no need to refresh your page.
